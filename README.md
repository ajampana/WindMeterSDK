##Wind Meter SDK for iOS

####Lightweight Integration
The lightweight integration option allows developers to leverage the WeatherFlow Wind Meter app's user interface directly eliminating the need to build and maintain their own interface for the purpose of displaying real-time wind data.  This option utilizes a custom URL scheme to pass data between the WeatherFlow Wind Meter app and the developer's app.

This option does NOT require embedding an SDK but rather leverages the WeatherFlow Wind Meter app.

####Full Integration

The full integration option allows developers to utilize the WindMeterSDK directly to obtain raw data from Wind Meter.  This option gives developers full control to display the Wind Meter's raw data in real-time within their app.  

This option requires developers to integrate the WeatherFlow Wind Meter static library into their app.
